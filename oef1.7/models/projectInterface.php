//    Has methods that must be included in classes that implement this interface. They are a type of abstract class.
//    The methods listed here are empty shells though and each class will give it body according to its own needs.
//    An interface cannot be instantiated and functions merely as a blueprint for other classes. They are more flexible in the sense that they
//    still allow each class to give their own content to a certain method, but they provide a common structure to your classes.
//    I have no inspiration for an interface that would make this application work more efficiently though...
